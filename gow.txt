Readers and critics of The Grapes of Wrath often comment on the symphonic variety of voices and forms that collectively compose the book. 
    The voice of the narrator is by turns realistic, lyrical, mythical, folksy, and biblical. 
    And the form that the narrative adopts is likewise unusual: 
    Half of the narrative follows the plot of the Joad family, the other half is a mosaic of
     American voices, scenes, and situations. The novel's complex variety of forms and focuses 
     could be the subjects for an essay. For example, you might analyze the ways that the complexity 
     of the story's narration—particularly the switching of voices—further broadens the scope of the novel. 
     No matter what topic you choose to analyze, you must first contend with Steinbeck's use of language. 
     This section of the chapter will demonstrate how to read closely two early passages in 
     The Grapes of Wrath in preparation for writing an essay.
